Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
    Ans: To store and organize information.
List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
    Ans: Databases, Operating system
what is an Array?
    Ans: Container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type.
what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
    Ans: Array is fixed size, ArrayList is dynamic.
what is LinkedList?
    Ans: Linear data structure where each element is a separate object.
what is queue?
    Ans: A queue is an ordered list of objects with its use limited to inserting elements at the end of list
    and deleting elements from the start. Uses FIFO.
what is stack?
    Ans: A LIFO ordered list of objects.
what is FIFO and LIFO?
    Ans: FIFO - First in First out, LIFO - Last in First out
what is the order of complexity?
    Ans: When you optimize code for speed, if an input requires size of N in the code, it will have O(N) complexity.
what is the best case to search an element from an array?
    Ans: First element of the list.
what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
    Ans: Last element of the list.
what is tree in data structure?
    Ans: simulates a hierarchical tree structure, with a root value and subtrees of children with a parent node,
    represented as a set of linked nodes.
what is graph in data structure?
    Ans: Consists of finite set of vertices or nodes together with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices
    for an undirected graph or a set of ordered pairs for a directed graph.
what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
    Ans: HashTable is synchronized whereas HashMap is not. Iterator in HashMap is fail-safe while enumerator for the
    HashTable isn't. Hashmap permits null values in it, HashTable doesn't.
What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
    Ans: RDBMS - Array
    Network data model - Graph
    Hierarchical data model - Trees
How HashMap works in java?
    Ans: HashMap provides put(key, value) for storing and get(key) method for retrieving values from HashMap.
What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
    Ans: An object of this class is thrown when code accesses an array with an illegal index.
What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
    Ans: Create the new array, copy the first array and store the values into the new array.
What is difference between an array and a linked list?
    Ans: Array size is fixed but Linked List is dynamic in size.
What is DFS and BFS?
    Ans: Depth First Search and Breadth First Search
What is Recursion?
    Ans: A method calls itself.
What is Big-(O)-notation?
    Ans: describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. Big O specifically describes the worst-case scenario,
    and can be used to describe the execution time required or the space used by an algorithm
Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?
    Ans: QuickSort- O(nlog(n)) , MergeSort- O(nlog(n)), HeapSort- O(nlog(n)), InsertionSort- O(n^2),
     SelectionSort-O(n^2)

Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and
disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element
